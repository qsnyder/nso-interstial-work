# NSO Interstial Work

Focus of this README is to centralize all available NSO resources available through Cisco DevNet in order to create a single landing page that can be iterated over time.

This page may move to a central organization or migrated to a page within DevNet, at which point the README will indicate the new location of the information and the last edit date of this page.

## Sandbox Resources

All material linked is supported within the [DevNet NSO Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/43964e62-a13c-4929-bde7-a2f68ad6b27c?diagramType=Topology), which can be reserved for a maximum duration of a week.

Alternatively, these examples could be completed on a local installation of NSO, with modifications to the files required to match IP addressing, etc.  Either physical devices or NETSIM nodes would be need to provide a testbed set of devices to automate against.

Use of a system installation of NSO *should be* possible, but out of scope for this discussion.
